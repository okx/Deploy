## WARING ⚠️

This directory is a placeholder for the zknode setup instructions. The instructions are split into two files, one for mainnet and one for testnet. The instructions are almost identical, with the only difference being the network-specific configurations.

### mainnet
* reference: [mainnet/setup-zknode-rpc.md](./mainnet/setup-zknode-rpc.md)
### testnet
* reference: [testnet/setup-zknode-rpc.md](./testnet/setup-zknode-rpc.md)
